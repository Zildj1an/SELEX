Biotechnological protocol for obtaining trained libraries of aptamer molecules automated with the Opentrons OT-2 robot.
This protocol is a part of our contribution to the 2019 iGEM international biotechnology competition. More information at <a href = "https://2019.igem.org/Team:MADRID_UCM/Landing">website</a>.

_The robot and The Ninja-PCR PCB_

The small-sized thermal cycler is controlled via motherboard Ninja-PCR Arduino-alike, as shown below, manually welded, whose code is in NinjaPCR [folder](https://github.com/Zildj1an/SELEX/tree/master/NinjaPCR). You can update a new binary since ESP8266 SystemOnChip includes the TCP/IP stack.
